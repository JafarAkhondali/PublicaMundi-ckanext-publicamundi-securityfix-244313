============

Install
-------

Some external libraries are needed for captchas to work (image processing). We use the `wheezy.captcha` Python
which on its turn requires PIL or Pillow libraries to work with.

On a debian-based system, the following will be adequate:

    apt-get install libjpeg libjpeg-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev


Afterwards, install Pip requirements as usual:

    pip install -r theme-requirements.txt
